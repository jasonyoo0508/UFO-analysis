# UFO-analysis

## Purpose & Overview

Purpose of the webpage and this project is to add more filtering options and abilities to the website on the UFO sightings. The filter abilities should display in a form of table that would be able to filter the search criteria in 5 different filter options.

## Filtering options

The left sidebar shows the filtering options. 
From top to bottom, it indicates filter criteria from date, city, state, country, and shape.

By selecting one of the options, users can filter the findings by 5 different criteria.

The above image shows the filter on the 'shapes'. By typing in the specific item 'triange' which is under 'shapes', the results would show all the triangle shaped findings.

The last image above shows the search bar when the users type in the 'country'. 
This would be applicable to other 3 filtering options which would be the search by date, city, and state. 

## Summary

1. One of the biggest drawback for the website or the filtering option would be that the users would have to actually know what parameters or items are in each of the filtering criteria. For example, There are 7+ items in the 'shapes' criteria and the users would need to type in the exact shapes into the searchbar.

2. Also, the filter options would not be able to perform multi filter options. For example, the user may want to search for a 'triangle' shape with 'us' for the country criteria. The website won't be able to perform the combined filter option.

To resolve the issue, one would be able to actually list all the options on next to the filter bar. For example, next to the 'shape' category, one can list all the available shapes.
